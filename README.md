Uncovering the role of green house gases in our neighbourhood

Our project delved into the hidden patterns of CO2 emissions across the United States. By harnessing the power of geospatial data, we mapped the evolution of emissions over ten years. Zooming in on Texas, we extracted location data, transformed it into a digestible format, and charted the rise and fall of CO2 levels. To broaden our perspective, we ventured beyond borders, gathering global data on both CO2 and methane emissions. Our Tableau dashboard unveiled a captivating visual narrative, revealing the intricate dance of these greenhouse gases across the planet. This exploration sheds light on the urgent need for sustainable practices and informed climate action.
